Japanese Sausage
Japanese sausages are typically 3 inches (7.6 cm). If your sausages are longer, cut them into 3-inch (7.6-cm) pieces. To cut the octopus "legs," lay the sausage sideways on the cutting board. On the bottom half of the sausage, insert the knife in the middle and slice all way through. Then, rotate the sausage 90 degrees and slice again. Now the sausage has four “legs.“
Octopus Sausage 1
Cut again between the slits to make eight legs. Hold the legs together so that the slits don’t open up when you slice through. Repeat with the other sausages.
Octopus Sausage 2
In a small frying pan, heat a little bit of oil and cook the sausages on medium heat. As the sausages cook, the legs will start to open up and flare out. When the sausages are cooked through, remove from the heat and serve or pack in your lunch box.
Octopus Sausage 3
Add sesame seeds for octopus eyes. Enjoy!
